I wanted to start a blog, but for some reason I didn't really like all the free options out there, or the paid ones for that matter, so I decided to create one myself. In the process I wanted to reconnect with JS and try out React Hooks (yes, welcome to 2019 etc.). To save myself some time I decided to go Gatsby as a static site generator and focus on building the components and adding the content. The use of React Hooks eneded up being very limited and I mostly copyied my designs from Figma directly in the styled components. 
Overall it was a positive experience and I'm glad I put in the effort to build the blog site. Final result available here - [Svetlo.co.uk](https://svetlo.co.uk)
